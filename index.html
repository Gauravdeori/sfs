    <h2>📖 History of Fransalian High School, Jonai</h2>

    <p>
      The mission at Jonai was initiated in <strong>1979</strong> by 
      <strong>Fr. Abraham Kuttiankal</strong>, who was then serving as an Assistant Parish Priest 
      at Kumrikatta for one year. He was later assigned to Jonai in the Dhemaji district 
      to begin pastoral and educational work in the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prior to the arrival of the <strong>Missionaries of St. Francis de Sales (MSFS)</strong>, 
      Catholics had already been present in Jonai for nearly two years. These early Catholic 
      settlers were mainly <strong>Garo families</strong> who had migrated for work to the land 
      of the <strong>Adi community of Arunachal Pradesh</strong>. Recognizing the need for 
      spiritual unity, Fr. Abraham Kuttiankal brought these families together and began 
      conducting Sunday services and prayer gatherings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, the Catholic population of the area grew into an organized community, and 
      regular Sunday Mass was established. In the middle of <strong>1979</strong>, a significant 
      milestone was achieved when <strong>Fr. Cherian Moolamattom</strong>, the Vicar General of 
      the Tezpur Diocese, was invited to bless and inaugurate the newly constructed school 
      building. The <strong>Sub-Divisional Officer</strong> attended the event as the Chief Guest.
    </p>

    <p>
      The school was dedicated to <strong>St. Francis de Sales</strong> and was officially named 
      <strong>“Fransalian School”</strong>. However, due to pronunciation difficulties, it soon 
      became popularly known among locals as the <strong>“French School”</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite being established midway through the academic year, the school began its journey 
      with <strong>65 students</strong> enrolled in Lower Kindergarten (LKG). Among the first 
      students were <strong>Khogen Mardi</strong> and <strong>Dubai Soren</strong>. The first 
      teaching staff of the school included <strong>Lucy Touro</strong>, 
      <strong>Lucy Emmanuel</strong>, and <strong>Alice</strong>, who laid the foundation of 
      academic excellence and discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fr. Abraham Kuttiankal served the mission faithfully until <strong>1983</strong>, 
      contributing significantly to its early growth and stability. Between 
      <strong>1990 and 1995</strong>, the school underwent major development with the extension 
      of classrooms and the creation of a playground, addressing the increasing needs of students.
    </p>

    <p>
      To further support academic life, a <strong>full-fledged bookstall</strong> was established 
      for the benefit of both students and staff. <strong>Sr. Theresa Kurian</strong>, while 
      serving as the Superior, took up the responsibility of managing the bookstall with 
      dedication.
    </p>

    <p>
      A proud moment in the school’s history was the celebration of its 
      <strong>Silver Jubilee (1979–2004)</strong>. The year-long celebrations began on 
      <strong>25 March 2004</strong> and concluded on <strong>1 November 2004</strong>, with the 
      main celebrations held from <strong>30 October to 1 November 2004</strong>.
